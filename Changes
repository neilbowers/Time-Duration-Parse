    - Switched to plain Exporter, instead of Exporter::Lite.
      Thanks to Graham Knop for PR.

0.15 2019-05-12 NEILB
    - Added support for fractional parts of seconds in hh:mm:ss.ssss
    - Added L<> links to Time::Duration and duration_exact in that module.
    - Fixed grammar in doc

0.14 2018-06-29 NEILB
    - Added "hrs" as another form for "hours". Thanks to Stig for the PR.

0.13 2015-10-25 NEILB
    - Added additional abbrevations for 'months': 'mo', 'mon', 'mons'.
      Thanks to PERLANCAR.
    - Rewrote the main testsuite to be data driven, to make it easy to
      add test cases, as for the above change.
    - Updated github repo URL after changing my github username

0.12 2015-07-02 NEILB
    - Added [MetaJSON] to dist.ini, so the dist will get a META.json file.
      RT#105627 from ETHER.

0.11 2014-03-26 NEILB
    - Min perl version now set to 5.6.0
    - Added description of DateTime::Format::Duration to SEE ALSO

0.10 2014-03-24 NEILB
    - Switched to Dist::Zilla. The Module::Install Makefile.PL was resulting
      in dependency problems and CPAN Testers fails, and I'm not familiar with
      it. Easier to switch. Thanks to ZEFRAM for pointing out the problem.

0.09 2014-03-23 NEILB
    - Test::More and Time::Duration were listed as build_requires;
      changed them to test_requires, with versions. Wonder if this was
      the cause of the small number of CPAN Testers fails?
    - Added more more modules to the SEE ALSO section in the pod.

0.08 2014-03-23 NEILB
    - Can now have a leading '+', as in '+2h'.
      Suggested by MSCHWERN in RT#66572
    - Added github repo to metadata (thanks dsteinbrunner)
    - Added github repo to pod
    - Added Time::Duration::Parse::More to SEE ALSO

0.07 2014-03-21 NEILB
    - Added 'use warnings'
    - Specified min perl version as 5.6.0 in Makefile.PL
